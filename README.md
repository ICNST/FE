# ICNST App Project

## Project Name
International Child Nutrition Status Tracking

## Pitch
There are a lot of child malnutrition nonprofits around the globe. Itâ€™s difficult to keep track of all the data for thousands of kids who are screened. This app allows their data to be entered, saved, and tracked over time. It keeps records organized by both country name and community name.
